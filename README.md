📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a Fake News Detection model that classifies news articles as REAL or FAKE using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.
The rise of fake news has created challenges in verifying trustworthy information. This model aims to assist in detecting misleading or fabricated news efficiently.

#🚀 Features

Preprocessing of raw text (removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters).

Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Training a Passive Aggressive Classifier for binary classification.

Achieved an accuracy of 92.8% on the dataset.

Evaluation using confusion matrix and performance metrics.

#📂 Dataset

The dataset used contains labeled news articles categorized as REAL or FAKE.

Columns include:

title: The news headline.

text: The body of the article.

label: Target variable (REAL or FAKE).


#📊 Model Training & Evaluation

Preprocess dataset using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Train a Passive Aggressive Classifier on the training set.

Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Visualize results using a confusion matrix.

✅ Achieved 92.8% accuracy on test data.



Use deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers like BERT).

Deploy the model as a web application using Flask/Streamlit.

Expand dataset for better generalization.
